I have fired up this channel to give the working group a place to chat. This channel is read-only to all `devs` outside of the working group team.

We need to set up a project plan to get some of the strategies investigated more with the data we have. As a reminder, the _assignment_ to this group is to present possible solutions to the DAO for our Early Contributor Rewards allocation. Modifying the Coordinape results as needed to ensure it matches the ratified purpose: to reward true early contributors of the DAO.

In parallel with this effort, contribution leaders will begin verifying true contributors. We can assume that we will be getting a list of verified & unverified contributors.This will allow strategies that limit the amount of $CODE received by unverified contributors.

As an initial question, **do we have team members who are very interested in dealing with the data and running different scenarios?**

We will look to setup some working time with these members as soon as possible to begin preparing different scenarios.
